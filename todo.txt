Yeah I'm lazy to make a proper todo list so here it is! 

- Proper cli logging instead of always using console.logging

- Guild-specific configuration









config script

okay so say we wanna do some things... all this happens within the promise I guess?

-print intro
-print prompt about command prefix
-while <cmd_pfx> value is null, yield return null
-once <cmd_pfx> recieved, continue
-print explanation about default text channel
-search for all text channels in this user's Guild
-print them out, ask which they'd like to use
-while <dft_chl> is null, yield return null
-once <dft_chl> is recieved, continue
-confirmation prompt (show collected details)
-while waiting for confirmation, yield return null
-once confirmation recieved, save data to object (also, write json to file as a hard save)


BUT how do we get those values? The input is from a discord message, without any prefix or anything.
The only distinction is the message author and the fact that it's coming from the DMs.
We recieve the messages with events, so we can't exactly do a classical prompt dialogue thingie.
