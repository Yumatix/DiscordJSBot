Yeah I'm lazy to make a proper todo list so here it is! 

- Shutdown broadcast, with optional shutdown reason

- Proper cli logging instead of always using console.logging

- *More* Guild-specific configuration (permissions, etc)

- Error handling all througout

- Message deleting (delete command messages, delete "now playing" messages and links and stuff)

- Moderation support

- Auto disconnect 


Long term: 

- Maybe look into sharding and better hosting? Idek

- Some in-chat games! Things to do with friends I guess
